AUTHOR ESCORTS: For a guided walk to your presentation room, please
go to the Author Hospitality Suite and an author escort will take you to your
presentation room. Author escorts will also be available at the Yellow
entrance to help guide authors to the Author Hospitality Suite.
MEETING UP : We suggest that authors plan to meet up with their
groupings and any introducers/moderators for their session at the
hospitality suite, prior to their event start time. An author escort can then
guide you to your presentation room as a group.
Getting To Your Presentation
MBF Author guide
In most cases, authors will each have 15 minutes to talk about and present
their book to attendees. This can include a reading, a short slideshow, or
other presentation style. 
For conversations that include a moderator: The program will be more
conversational in nature, though you can still plan for a short reading and
show images if needed. 
ALL PRESENTATIONS: A Room Host will greet you and start the session
with author introductions. All presentations will end with an audience Q&A,
followed by a book signing. 
AUTOGRAPHING AREAS: All venues have a nearby autographing area.
Our Autographing Committee will help guide you to the signing table after
your event. Please let them know whether they should prepare for
personalization w/post-its.
