All venues have the capability
to show images, but not all can
relay audio. The venues are not
MAC-friendly, so please plan
accordingly. Bring your
presentation on a USB flash
drive and check-in at your
presentation room at least 10
minutes in advance to meet
with the technician. 
If you would like to present
images, slides, or video
please complete the below
form by Nov. 15.
