MUST-SEE MUSIC ACTS:
The Rock Bottom Remainders | Saturday, Nov 23. 7 p.m. 
The ROCK BOTTOM REMAINDERS, an endearingly ragtag cover band
established in 1992 and mostly made up of high-profile published authors,
performed at Miami Book Fair more than a dozen times over the years.
And they’re reuniting right here this year, bringing together a lineup not
seen together on stage for more than a decade! Meet the latest iteration
of the group – which includes MITCH ALBOM, DAVE BARRY, SAM BARRY,
ROY BLOUNT JR., GREG ILES, MARY KARR, STEPHEN KING, RIDLEY
PEARSON, AMY TAN, SCOTT TUROW, and ALAN ZWEIBEL.
Gavin Turek | Saturday, Nov. 23 5 p.m.
A disco queen for the modern era, Gavin Turek makes dance music that
trades escapism for alchemy, transforming heartbreak and hurt into
moments of absolute glory. 
Celia Cruz All Stars | Sunday, Nov. 24 6 p.m. 
So much more than a tribute band, “The Celia Cruz All Stars” musicians
actually played with Celia during her illustrious career. Fans call the group
“Classic Celia” with a funky, contemporary twist.
