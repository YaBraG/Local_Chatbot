HOTEL INCIDENTALS: Miami Book
Fair only covers the cost of the hotel
room night. Each guest is
responsible for any incidental
expenses incurred during their stay,
and a credit card will be required
at check-in for that purpose. If a
debit card is used at check-in,
please note that the hotel will
charge a deposit on the debit card.
At the conclusion of the stay, the
hotel will process a credit if no
incidental charges were incurred.

PER DIEMS
PLEASE NOTE: The Miami Book Fair
does not offer transportation
to/from the airport. We recommend
using a rideshare service, and we
have assigned a per diem of $50
per hotel night covered by the Book
Fair to offset that cost. Please see
below for per diem pickup info.
All per diems MUST be picked up
in person while at the festival.
Miami Book Fair does not mail
out per diems that have been left
behind.
