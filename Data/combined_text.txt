JIM DEFEDE, BILLY CORBEN & ALFRED SPELLMAN 
ON THE CHRONICLES OF WILLY & SAL – PANEL
 This is a FREE ticketed event. For information on how to access all MBF24 programs, visit MiamiBookFair.com.
Join veteran Miami journalist JIM DEFEDE and filmmakers BILLY CORBEN and ALFRED 
SPELLMAN as they share memories of Miami in the wild 1990s through the strange-but-true 
exploits, excesses, and ultimate downfall of two local drug kingpins. DeFede’s decadelong 
coverage of the federal government’s pursuit of Augusta “Willy” Falcon and Salvador 
Magluta, the Magic City’s infamous “Cocaine Cowboys,” was collected by Miami New Times 
in The Chronicles of Willy & Sal, a story that Corben and Spellman explored in their award-
winning documentary series Cocaine Cowboys: The Kings of Miami. Moderated by TOM 
FINKEL, Miami New Times editor-in-chief.
The Chronicles of Willy & Sal was made possible through a generous grant from Knight 
Foundation.

AN EVENING WITH DON LEMON ON I ONCE 
WAS LOST: MY SEARCH FOR GOD IN AMERICA

 This is a ticketed event that includes the book ($35) and free access to Street 
Fair. For ticketing options and information on how to access all other programs, visit 
MiamiBookFair.com.
Renowned journalist DON LEMON always had a complicated relationship with 
God. He cherished the Southern Black church he was raised in but struggled 
with the fundamentalist rejection of his right to exist as a gay man – one who 
wanted to marry his longtime love in a church wedding with all the traditional 
trimmings. In his work as a reporter, moreover, he saw his fellow Americans 
losing faith in a higher power, in institutions, and in each other. Setting out 
to understand the place that religion has in our lives today, Lemon turned a 
journalistic eye on ancient stories and found connections that sparked memories, 
conversations, and chance encounters. Then, suddenly, 
his world unraveled: In a blaze of inglorious headlines, 
he was ousted from his high-profile network news job 
and tasked with redefining his role in the shifting media 
landscape. But through a year of personal changes and 
professional whiplash, he kept his “eyes on the prize” 
and ultimately found what he was seeking: grace, 
within himself and in this nation we call home. Rich 
with humor and Louisiana realness, I Once Was Lost 
is a prayer for a country that reflects the multifaceted 
image of God and a clarion call to those who believe in 
our common humanity enough to fight for it.

AN EVENING WITH AMIR TIBON ON THE GATES OF GAZA: 
A STORY OF BETRAYAL, SURVIVAL, AND HOPE IN ISRAEL’S BORDERLANDS

 This is a ticketed event that includes the book ($35) and free access to Street Fair. For 
ticketing options and information on how to access all other programs, visit MiamiBookFair.com.
On the morning of October 7, 2023, AMIR TIBON and his wife were awakened by 
mortar rounds exploding near their home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, an Israeli community 
less than a mile from Gaza City. Soon, they were holding their two young daughters 
in the family’s reinforced safe room, urging them not to cry as gunfire echoed just 
outside the door. With his cell phone battery running low, Tibon texted his father: 
“The girls are behaving really well, but I’m worried they’ll lose patience soon and 
Hamas will hear us.” Some 45 miles north, Tibon’s parents had just cut short an early 
morning swim along the shores of Tel Aviv. Now, they jumped in their Jeep and sped 
toward Nahal Oz, armed only with a pistol but intent on saving their family at all costs. 
In The Gates of Gaza: A Story of Betrayal, Survival, and Hope in Israel’s Borderlands 
(Little, Brown and Company), Tibon tells this harrowing story in full 
for the first time. He describes his family’s ordeal and the bravery 
that ultimately led to their rescue alongside the histories of the 
place they call home and the systems of power that have kept them 
and their neighbors in Gaza in harm’s way for decades. More than 
one family’s odyssey, The Gates of Gaza is the intimate story of 
a tight-knit community and the broader saga of war and hostility 
between two national movements – a conflict that has not yet 
extinguished the enduring hope for peace.

ON ABSOLUTION

 This is a ticketed event that includes free access to this program as well as 
the weekend Street Fair, where you’ll find literary events, live music, children’s 
activities, booksellers, local artisans, and gourmet delights! For information on 
how to access all other programs, visit MiamiBookFair.com.
American women have been mostly minor characters in the literature of 
the Vietnam War, but in ALICE MCDERMOTT’s Absolution they take center 
stage. Tricia is a shy newlywed, married to a rising attorney on loan to 
navy intelligence; Charlene is a practiced corporate spouse and mother of 
three, a beauty and a bully. In 1963 Saigon, the two form a wary alliance 
as they balance the era’s mandate to be “helpmeets” to their ambitious 
husbands with their own inchoate impulse to “do good” for the people of 
Vietnam. Sixty years later, Charlene’s daughter reaches out to Tricia and 
together they look back at their time in Saigon, revisiting that 
pivotal time and discovering how their own lives as women on 
the periphery – of politics, of history, of war, of their husbands’ 
convictions – have been shaped and burdened by the same 
sort of unintended consequences that followed America’s tragic 
interference in Southeast Asia.

An Evening to Remember
2024 MBF POSTER
MIAMI BOOK FAIR POSTER
A highlight of every Miami Book Fair is selecting a different artist 
each year to create a work of art that embodies what Miami Book 
Fair is all about. This year that symbolic brush is being held by 
NICOLE J. SAMPER, a Miami-based artist and graphic designer who 
is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at New World 
School of the Arts. Her concept was inspired by downtown Miami – 
its skyline, diversity, and “melting pot of different countries coming 
together.” With colorful depictions of books as buildings against a 
bright azure sky, the work immediately draws you in.
“Past Miami Book Fair poster artists 
have done such an amazing job at 
portraying what the Fair is about 
through their illustrations and graphics,” 
said Samper. “I was so humbled that I 
was even [considered] this year, and 
when I found out I was selected it was 
like an out of body experience!”

AN EVENING WITH ERIK LARSON ON THE DEMON 
OF UNREST: A SAGA OF HUBRIS, HEARTBREAK, AND 
HEROISM AT THE DAWN OF THE CIVIL WAR

 This is a ticketed event that includes the book ($35) and free access to Street Fair. For 
ticketing options and information on how to access all other programs, visit MiamiBookFair.com.
ERIK LARSON offers a gripping account of the chaotic months between Abraham 
Lincoln’s November 6, 1860, election and the Confederacy’s shelling of Sumter – a 
period marked by tragic errors and miscommunications, enflamed egos and craven 
ambitions, personal tragedies and betrayals. At the heart of this suspense-filled 
narrative are Maj. Robert Anderson, Sumter’s commander and a former slave owner 
sympathetic to the South but loyal to the Union; Edmund Ruffin, a vain and bloodthirsty 
radical who stirs secessionist ardor at every opportunity; and 
Mary Boykin Chesnut, wife of a prominent planter, conflicted over 
both marriage and slavery and seeing parallels between them. 
In the middle of it all is the overwhelmed Lincoln, battling with 
his duplicitous secretary of state, William Seward, as he tries 
desperately to avert a war that he fears is inevitable, one that 
will eventually kill 750,000 Americans. Drawing on diaries, secret 
communiques, slave ledgers, and plantation records, Larson gives 
us a political horror story that captures the forces that led America 
to the brink – a dark reminder that we often don’t see a cataclysm 
coming until it’s too late. Moderated by DAVID LERNER-SCHWARTZ, 
award-winning author and professor of English in the MFA program 
at the University of Central Florida.

AN EVENING WITH CLARISSA WARD ON ON ALL 
FRONTS: THE EDUCATION OF A JOURNALIST

 This is a ticketed event that includes the book ($25) and free access to Street 
Fair. For ticketing options and information on how to access all other programs, visit 
MiamiBookFair.com.
In this strange age of crisis where there really is no front line, conflict journalist 
CLARISSA WARD has moved from one hot zone to the next. With multiple 
assignments in Syria, Gaza, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, Ward – who speaks seven 
languages – has been based in Baghdad, Beirut, Beijing, and 
Moscow. She has seen and documented the violent remaking of 
the world at close range, and with deep empathy finds a way 
to tell the hardest stories. On All Fronts: The Education of a 
Journalist is the riveting account of her singular career and of 
journalism in this age of extremism. Following a privileged but 
lonely childhood, Ward found her calling as an international war 
correspondent in the aftermath of 9/11. From her early days 
in the field, she was embedded with marines at the height of 
the Iraq War and reporting from the center of Israel’s war with 
Hezbollah. Soon she was on assignment all over the globe, and 
from her multiple stints entrenched with Syrian rebels to her 
deep investigations into the Western extremists who are drawn 
to ISIS, Ward covered Bashar al-Assad’s reign of terror without 
fear and with courage and compassion. Hers is an unforgettable 
story of one extraordinary journalist – and of a changing world.

AN EVENING IN PORTUGAL – 
50 YEARS OF THE CARNATION REVOLUTION 
THROUGH PORTUGUESE LITERATURE

Fifty years ago, the Carnation Revolution brought profound social 
and artistic transformations to Portugal. These changes were vividly 
reflected in literature, giving rise to a celebrated new generation of 
post-revolution writers. As we commemorate 50 years of creative 
freedom in Portuguese literature, we’ll explore the impact of these 
historical milestones on the art of writing.
Joining us are JOSÉ LUÍS PEIXOTO, distinguished Portuguese writer, 
poet, and recipient of the 2001 José Saramago Award, whose 
work has been published and translated into 30 languages, and 
JUDITE CANHA FERNANDES, Portuguese poet, novelist, dramatist, 
and recipient of the 2020 Best Narrative Fiction Book award from 
the Portuguese Society of Authors. She is currently working on 
an essay about the Carnation Revolution. Moderated by San Diego 
State University professor RICARDO VASCONCELOS, PH.D., we’ll 
delve into the unique contributions of these two remarkable voices 
in Portuguese literature. A performance by Arte Total including 
contemporary dance and a spoken-word poem, Musa, by SOPHIA 
DE MELLO BREYNER, will open the evening; “A Taste of Portugal” 
networking session with Portuguese wine and delicacies will follow.
Presented in partnership with Susana Cerqueira, founder of Sete 
Luas Books, and Carolina Rendeiro, CEO of Connect2Global. This event 
is sponsored by the Luso-American Foundation for Development 
(FLAD), the Embassy of Portugal to the United States of America, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Republica Portuguesa – Cultura/ 
Direcção-Geral das Artes.

MEMOIR

 This is a ticketed event that includes the book ($35) and free access to Street 
Fair. For ticketing options and information on how to access all other programs, visit

In Connie: A Memoir, trailblazing Asian American journalist CONNIE CHUNG pulls 
no punches as she shares a behind-the-scenes tour of her life and career, from 
showdowns with powerful men in and out of the newsroom – 
where overt sexism was a way of life – to the stories behind 
some of her career-defining reporting. Tenacious in her pursuit of 
stories, Chung battled rival reporters to land scoops that ranged 
from covering the Watergate scandal – which included her 
first big interview, with President Richard Nixon – to being the 
first journalist to speak with NBA legend Magic Johnson after he 
announced he was HIV-positive. She quickly became a household 
name and made history as the first woman to co-anchor CBS 
Evening News and the first Asian to anchor any news program in 
the country. Now, she’s telling her own story, one described by 
Kirkus as “an irreverent, inspiring chronicle of a great life.”

LIT ENCOUNTERS BY THEVERSEVERSE

Celebrating Latino Poetry: The Library of America’s Anthology with special programming during 
Miami Book Fair week, Lit Encounters is a special exhibition presented by MAD ARTS in partnership 
with digital poetry gallery THEVERSEVERSE that brings one of humanity’s most enduring forms of 
expression into the museum space as the main event! Gathering writers, visual artists, and code 
poets, the exhibition reimagines the bounds of how poetry is experienced via a multiplicity of 
mediums and technologies, including blockchain as a means of publishing, distribution, and record-
keeping. This experience expands how poems can look, sing, and behave, ultimately demanding a 
reconsideration of the cultural currency of verse. Lit Encounters opens November 2, 2024.
See your favorite local poets at Lit Encounters in an intimate, one-of-a-kind format – as holograms! – through 
Poetry Holobox, which will also be on display during MBF week at MDC’s Wolfson Campus in the Building 1 Atrium.

 This is a ticketed event that includes the book ($35) and free access to Street Fair. For 
ticketing options and information on how to access all other programs, visit MiamiBookFair.com.
In 2016, AMY TAN grew overwhelmed by the state of the world: 
Hatred and misinformation became a daily presence on social 
media and the country felt more divisive than ever. In search 
of peace, she turned toward the natural world just beyond her 
window and, specifically, the birds visiting her yard. But what 
began as an attempt to find solace turned into something far 
greater – an opportunity to savor quiet moments during a volatile 
time, connect to nature in a meaningful way, and imagine the 
intricate lives of the birds she admired. In The Backyard Bird 
Chronicles (Knopf) Tan tracks the natural beauty that surrounds 
us and maps the passage of time. Through daily entries, 
thoughtful questions, beautiful original sketches, and boundless 
charm and wit, she shares her foray into birding and the wonders 
of the world. Moderated by writer, award-winning nature 
photographer, and conservationist KIRSTEN HINES.

“MIAMI UNDERGROUND: WHAT

In the alt-culture scene of 1980s Miami, artists, 
music makers, and scenesters mixed in the 
few party and cultural spaces the city offered, 
creating multidisciplinary events thought of as 
“just parties and shows.” During that decade, 
more and more creatives settled in Miami, joining 
the natives who’d kick-started it all. By the time 
Hurricane Andrew hit in ’92, Miami was already 
heading toward what it is today, where Art Basel 
and the Ultra Music Festival anchor the seasons, 
and countless other cultural happenings can be 
found any day of the week. And yet it still takes 
a DIY attitude to break out and “make it” – 
here in Miami and beyond. Punk Under The Sun: 
Punk & New Wave in South Florida authors JOEY 
SEEMAN and CHRIS POTASH lead a discussion 
about Miami’s past and present DIY culture, with 
ALE CAMPOS and EMILIE MILGRIM of Miami-
based band Las Nubes, Artifacts Gallery founder 
HOWARD DAVIS, and author and drummer JOEY

LIVING YOUR BEST QUEER LIFE 
– MEMOIR 
Manboobs: A Memoir of Musicals, Visas, Hope, 
and Cake is KOMAIL AIJAZUDDIN’s story of 
courage, love, and bravery. Growing up in 
Pakistan, ashamed of his body and knowing he 
was different, he believed his only chance at 
happiness existed in a gay-friendly America. 
But after arriving in a post-9/11 world, he was 
forced to navigate prejudice and self-doubt 
in his quest for a meaningful life. In his part 
memoir-in-essays, part cultural critique Mean 
Boys: A Personal History, queer Chinese American 
writer GEOFFREY MAK speaks of boys wielding 
cruelty to claim their place in the pecking order. 
As such, they are the emblem of our image-
obsessed society and an era always thirsting 
for the next edgy thing, even at our peril. GREG 
MARSHALL’s Leg: The Story of a Limb and the 
Boy Who Grew from It is a funny and insightful 
memoir of a singular childhood. It is also a unique 
examination of what it means to transform when 
there are parts of yourself you can’t change, a 
moving portrait of a family in crisis, and a tale of 
resilience of spirit.

spans generations of one family, from early 
2000s New York City, where young and broke 
Lily Chen falls for dashing Matthew, to 2021, 
when 15-year-old Nick Chen searches for 
his biological father, a journey that produces 
more questions than answers. In DINAW 
MENGESTU’s Someone Like Us: A Novel, after 
abandoning his once-promising career as a 
journalist in search of a new life in Paris, 
Mamush found love and created a family with 
Hannah, a photographer. Five years later his 
marriage is collapsing, and Mamush returns 
to the Ethiopian community of his childhood 
in Washington, D.C., searching for answers 
to questions he was told never to ask. And in 
NAYANTARA ROY’s The Magnificent Ruins: A 
Novel, a woman returns to India from New 
York after inheriting her ancestral home, 
forced to confront her culture, estranged 
mother, and family all living under the same 
roof.

THE PAVILION (NE Second Ave. at NE Third St.)
REALMS & ROMANCE – 
FICTION
ROMINA GARBER’s Castle of the Cursed follows 
a girl’s supernatural path after her parents’ 
mysterious deaths. Suffering from survivor’s 
guilt, she goes to live with her estranged aunt 
at an ancestral Spanish castle that harbors 
a trove of family secrets. When she meets 
a silver-eyed boy that only she can see, they 
grudgingly team up to find answers, igniting 
an investigation – and romance. In MARY E. 
PEARSON’s The Courting of Bristol Keats: A 
Novel, Bristol and her sisters struggle mightily 
after losing their parents. Then, an “aunt” 
they’ve never heard of promises she can help 
– and suddenly everything Bristol thought 
she knew about her family is a lie. Her father 
might even be alive – not killed, but taken 
by terrifying creatures to another realm. 
NATASHA PULLEY’s queer sci-fi story The Mars 
House: A Novel, January, once a principal in 
London’s Royal Ballet, has become a refugee 
in a terraformed colony on Mars. There, his 
life is dictated by his second-class status as 
an Earthstronger – a person whose body 
is not adjusted to lower gravity – and the 
xenophobic politics at play.

MANGO TREE/LA MATA DE 
MANGO – PICTURE BOOK
Cuban American artist EDEL RODRIGUEZ 
presents The Mango Tree/La mata de mango, an 
enchanting wordless picture book that captures 
his own childhood experience as an immigrant. 
Colorful and bold visuals tell the story of two 
boys who spend their days in a mango tree high 
above the rest of the world. But after a huge 
storm sweeps one boy out into unknown waters, 
he finds himself alone in a strange new land 
where everything is different and unfamiliar. 
Dive into this tale of new experiences,

“STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS 
OF ANCESTORS: MIDDLE GRADE 
ADVENTURES” – FICTION
Three young adventurers rise to the challenge 
to chart their own course! In RUTH BEHAR’s 
Across So Many Seas, while on a family 
vacation to Spain, Paloma retraces four 
generations of Jewish women as they travel 
across Europe, Cuba, and Miami to flee 
persecution and find opportunity. In Not 
Nothing by GAYLE FORMAN, 12-year-old Alex is 
stuck volunteering at a retirement home over 
the summer, but 117-year-old Josey’s vivid 
recounting of escaping ghettos, dragnets, and 
a concentration camp inspires the young boy 
to reflect on his own actions and make some 
changes in himself. And in CYNTHIA LEITICH 
SMITH’s On a Wing and a Tear, folklore takes 
the wheel as Great-Grandfather Bat has a 
torn wing but needs to make it to Chicago 
for a long-standing contest between Birds 
and Mammals. His only hope is two kids, a 
grandpa, and a fated road trip across the 
country.

Miami Film Festival
GEMS is Miami’s mini fall festival featuring more than 25 of the season’s top award contenders and 
prestige pictures. The ﬁ lms included in GEMS are some of the biggest titles traveling the world 
right now – not to mention the most lauded. From Audience Award winners such as the Tribeca 
Film Festival’s ¡Casa Bonita Mi Amor! to SXSW’s Bob Trevino Likes It and the Cannes Film Festival 
Grand Prix winner All We Imagine as Light, GEMS is ﬁ ve days of cinema heaven.
We’re kicking things of  in true Miami fashion with Pedro Almodóvar’s The Room Next Door, starring 
beloved actresses Julianne Moore and Tilda Swinton in the auteur’s ﬁ rst English-language feature. 
Miami Film Festival has championed Almodóvar’s work dating as far back as the very ﬁ rst edition 
of the festival back in 1984, and we’re thrilled to bring his latest ﬁ lm – which just won the prestigious 
Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival – to audiences all these years later. 
For our Centerpiece titles, it’s all about variety. First up is Emilia Pérez, directed by MFF alum and past 
award winner Jacques Audiard (Dheepan, Rust and Bone), starring Cannes best actress winner Karla 
Sofía Gascón alongside Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez. Like an electrifying telenovela, Emilia Pérez
takes you on an incendiary visual and auditory journey through Mexico City. 
And don’t think we forgot to bring the star power. As part of our brand-new partnership with The 
Hollywood Reporter, actor Sebastian Stan is coming to Miami. The Marvel star will be recording 
a live episode of the hugely popular “Awards Chatter” podcast with THR’s executive editor of 
awards, Scott Feinberg. 
Here to receive one of our top honors, Arianne Phillips joins us for a talk on her life as a ﬁ lm 
costume designer for many huge stars, including Lady Gaga, Timothée Chalamet and Madonna. 
She’ll reﬂ ect on her career in conversation at the Miami Fashion Institute at Miami Dade College. 
Closing out the festivities will be Searchlight’s A Real Pain. A smash hit at the most recent Sundance 
Film Festival, where it won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award, A Real Pain stars Jesse Eisenberg 
(who also wrote and directed the ﬁ lm) alongside Succession’s Kieran Culkin in this deeply af ecting 
exploration of generational trauma and modern angst. 
MFF is a year-round organization, and GEMS is one of two festivals that we host each year. Our larger 
festival, Miami Film Festival, is happening April 4-13, 2025, and will be packed with more than 100 great 
feature ﬁ lms, as well as celebrity conversations and ﬁ lmmaker panels. We also present a year-round 
Cuban Cinema Series, supported by ArtesMiami; a membership program called Miami Film Society that 
has screenings year-round; and we’ve launched a $100,000 fund for documentaries called The Louies. 
Enjoy Miami Film Festival GEMS and we’ll see you in the cinema.

Ingrid (Julianne Moore) and Martha (Tilda Swinton) were 
close friends in their youth. Ingrid went on to become an 
autoﬁ ction novelist while Martha became a war reporter, 
and they were separated by the circumstances of life. After 
years of being out of touch, they meet again. But the joys 
of being reunited are tempered when Martha makes a 
request, one that will test their newly strengthened bond. 
In legendary Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar’s 
ﬁ rst English-language feature ﬁ lm, all of his signature 
trademarks are on full display. Be it the vibrant color 
palette seen in Eduard Grau’s lush cinematography, the 
enviable set design or his uncanny ability to blend of beat
humor with melodrama, this is an Almodóvar ﬁ lm 
through and through. But what really sets The Room 
Next Door apart is the performances from Swinton and 
Moore. In one of the year’s most inspired pairings, the two 
beloved actresses bring a pathos and levity to the work.

Families are hard, and no one knows that better than 
mismatched cousins David (Jesse Eisenberg) and Benji 
(Kieran Culkin). The once-close men love each other 
deeply, but the years since their childhood have proven 
them to be dif erent in fundamental ways. David is a strict 
rule-follower, a ball of anxious nerves who likes to draw 
up a plan and stick to it. Benji is quite the opposite: 
a spontaneous social butterﬂ y who draws people in 
with his magnetism. But his charismatic exterior is one 
that hides a deep well of pain.
When the two reunite for a tour through Poland to honor 
their Holocaust-survivor grandmother, the adventure 
takes a turn as old tensions resurface against the 
backdrop of their family history.
Packed with a tremendous amount of empathy and 
humor, writer/director/star Eisenberg proves himself to 
be a true triple threat in this af ecting exploration of 
generational trauma and modern angst.

by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, and James Mangold’s A 
Complete Unknown, starring Timothée Chalamet, Edward Norton and Elle Fanning. Phillips’

a Time in Hollywood, James Mangold’s Walk the Line and Madonna’s W.E.

NOVEMBER 3 AT 2 PM | CGAC
Is Mumbai the city of dreams 
or illusions? It is a question 
posed midway through writer-
director Payal Kapadia’s lush, 
meditative feature following the 
interconnected lives of three 
nurses striving to ﬁ nd their 
truest selves amid the hustle 
and bustle of more than 20 
million fellow souls – no small 
feat in a metropolis where 
ancient tradition and modernity 
are quarreling neighbors.
The truth is, however, that
Mumbai – rendered here in all its 
kaleidoscopic complexity and as 
a character in its own right – may 
be neither dream nor illusion, 
but a knot to be untied between 
the threads of past and poten-
tial future. By the time we reach 
the Cannes 2024 Grand Prix 
award-winning ﬁ lm’s
heartrending, transcendent 
denouement, we realize the 
city’s constant state of 
becoming may be a reﬂ ection 
of its inhabitants’ hearts – and 
ours. 
BETTER MAN

NOVEMBER 2 AT 8 PM | SPOT
The Greatest Showman was 
one of the most successful 
musicals in a generation, 
and director Michael Gracey 
follows it up with Better Man, 
a fresh, inventive and original 
take on the musical-biopic. 
Better Man is based on the 
true story of the meteoric rise, 
dramatic fall and remarkable 
resurgence of British pop 
superstar Robbie Williams, one 
of the greatest entertainers 
of all time. Under Gracey’s 
visionary direction, the ﬁ lm is 
uniquely told from Williams’ 
perspective, capturing his 
signature wit and indomitable 
spirit. It follows his journey 
from childhood to being 
the youngest member of 
chart-topping boy band 
Take That, and through to his 
unparalleled achievements as 
a record-breaking solo artist 
– all the while confronting the 
challenges that stratospheric 
fame and success can bring. 
Better Man debuted to 
excellent reviews at the 
Telluride and Toronto ﬁ lm 
festivals.

It says a lot about this dark 
and beguiling coming-of-age 
fable that a subplot centered 
on the attempts of a ne’er-do-
well father (Barry Keoghan; 
Saltburn, The Banshees of 
Inisherin) to ﬁ nd the right 
indie pop song to coax 
hallucinogenic slime from 
an exotic toad is not its 
trippiest moment: Some 
of us, it seems, have indeed 
entertained angels – or 
at least mythological 
shapeshifters – unaware. And 
sometimes those guardians 
need a degree of saving, too. 
Maybe you could call 12-year-
old Bailey (a luminous and 
ﬁ erce Nykiya Adams) and her 
brother Hunter latchkey kids 
if their North Kent squat had 
a door to latch. The brutality 
and nihilism of the streets feels 
like an unavoidable vortex until 
the eccentric outsider Bird 
(Franz Rogowski; Passages) 
arrives out of nowhere on 
a quest to ﬁ nd his father, 
shifting the story into magical 
realism territory in which hope 
itself transforms from myth to 
tangible reality.

BOB TREVINO LIKES IT
Directed by 
Tracie Laymon
USA | 2024 | 102 min
English
NOVEMBER 1 AT 6:30 PM | KOUBEK
Bob Trevino Likes It is inspired by 
the true friendship that writer-
director Tracie Laymon found 
with a stranger when looking for 
her father online. Often playing 
the role of caretaker to people 
who should be caring for her, 
Lily Trevino (Barbie Ferreira) 
longs for a familial connection, 
having been abandoned by 
her mother as a child and then 
suddenly by her father in her 
twenties. Bob Trevino (John 
Leguizamo) works long hours 
alone at a construction company 
to support his wife, Jeanie. The 
couple has endured a lot in the 
past decade, to the point where 
Bob ignores his own feelings 
and need for connection. That 
is, until he gets an unexpected 
Facebook message from a 
stranger.
Anchored by Barbie Ferreira 
(HBO’s Euphoria) and 
Leguizamo’s heartfelt lead 
performances, this semi-
autobiographical feature 
will forever change the way 
you look at social media, 
scrapbooking, rage rooms 
and the obscured-yet-real 
interconnectedness of 
humanity.

OCTOBER 29 AT 7:30 PM | KOUBEK
Twelve year-old Desi struggles 
to navigate a traditional culture 
in which familial devotion and 
tight-knit community coexist 
uneasily alongside darker 
customs of sexual objectiﬁ cation
and gendered servitude. 
Though her destiny appears 
preordained, a serendipitous 
rendezvous with a group of 
young street rappers proves 
much is left unwritten. As she 
tests her mettle in lyrical 
battles, Desi’s revelatory 
stream-of-consciousness 
ﬂ ow gives voice to her 
unspoken dreams and builds 
her self-conﬁ dence, sending 
ripples of change throughout 
her family and community.  
This inspiring, thought-provoking 
Dominican coming-of-age 
feature – which won the 
Tribeca Film Festival Nora 
Ephron Award – serves as 
a powerful reminder that, if 
infused with the right melody 
and cadence, words can be 
spells – incantations that 
empower us to transcend the 
restrictive roles assigned to us 
and authentically self-actualize.

NOVEMBER 1 AT 9:30 PM | KOUBEK
It was known far and wide as 
the Disneyland of Mexican 
restaurants – a labyrinth-like 
Denver wonderland famous 
for its 30-foot waterfall and 
attendant clif  divers, throwback 
Western theme, massive gorilla 
mascot and food that was ... 
not so good. But when COVID-19 
forces the legendary Casa 
Bonita restaurant into 
bankruptcy, South Park
creators Trey Parker and Matt 
Stone see the opportunity 
to bring a childhood dream to 
life, buying the beleaguered 
landmark with an eye on
returning it to its early 1970s 
glory. Working with famed 
restaurateur Dana “Loca” 
Rodriguez to update the menu, 
and armed with more than 
$8 million for renovations, the 
pair soon realize that this dream 
might just be beyond their grasp 
as they face a deteriorating 
structure, rapidly aging ﬁ xtures 
and a spiraling budget. With 
a projected summer 2023 
opening date and the eyes of a 
nation upon them, Parker and 
Stone strive to see their vision 
through in this hilarious ode to 
the power of creativity and 
love for community. 
THE COLORS WITHIN

NOVEMBER 3 AT 5:15 PM | SPOT
“Colors, like features,” Pablo 
Picasso once said, “follow 
the changes of the emotions.” 
It’s a maxim that earns more 
validation than the Spanish 
artist could have ever dreamed 
in this vibrant, magical, end-
lessly af ecting animated fea-
ture from Naoko Yamada, the 
Japanese animator and 
director behind such landmark 
ﬁ lms as Liz and the Blue Bird 
(2018) and A Silent Voice: 
The Movie (2016). 
Young Totsuko possesses the 
ability to see and interpret 
what no one else can: the 
intrinsic, ethereal “colors” 
of others. As she seeks to 
balance this gift with her 
high school studies, 
transcendence-tinged band 
practice in an old remote 
island church and own coming 
of age, the previously esoteric 
question, what does it take to 
discover one’s true colors – and 
how to best help others 
discover theirs – transforms 
into tangible technicolor 
reality.

CRISTO

NOVEMBER 3 AT 5 PM | CGAC
Over the last century there 
have been more than 20 ﬁ lm 
adaptations of Alexandre 
Dumas’ 1844 novel of a 
wrongly imprisoned man’s 
righteous, elaborate revenge 
against the trio of dastardly 
men who betrayed him for 
personal gain, but none 
quite match the soul-stirring 
pathos, rapier-sharp action or 
sweeping grandeur found here.
Indeed, French directing team 
Matthieu Delaporte and 
Alexandre de La Patellière 
(The Best is Yet to Come, 
What’s in a Name?) treat the 
source material like the hidden 
treasure Edmond Dantès 
discovers in Monte Cristo, 
reveling in its Rube Goldberg 
machine-like plot with a 
devotion to detail and passion 
that makes it crackle with 
new resonance. 
Come ﬁ nd out why this 
modern epic masterpiece 
received a 12-minute standing 
ovation at the 77th Cannes 
Film Festival back in May.

he can “become legal.” But a

Julia compels Pedro to spiral

Arregi and Jon Garaño, of 
The Endless Trench and 
Handia, this is a gripping 
moral thriller inspired by the 
unbelievable true story of 
Enric Marco, a man who 
spent years perpetuating an 
unimaginable lie. It stars 
three-time Goya winner 
Eduard Fernández, who brings 
Marco to life, and two-time 
Goya winner Nathalie Poza in 
the role of his wife.

CENTERPIECE
NOVEMBER 1 AT 6:30 PM | SPOT
Maria tells the tumultuous, 
beautiful and tragic story of 
the life of the world’s greatest 
female opera singer, relived 
and reimagined during her 
ﬁ nal days in 1970s Paris.
Angelina Jolie shines in what 
is the most talked about 
performance of the season, a 
glorious portrait of Maria Callas 
directed by Miami Film 
Festival alumni Pablo Larraín, 
famous for the biopics No, 
Neruda, Jackie and Spencer. 
The ﬁ lm has wowed crowds at 
Venice, Telluride, Toronto and 
New York ﬁ lm festivals, and 
Jolie is widely seen to have 
secured her latest Oscar 
nomination (she is a supporting 
actress winner for Girl, 
Interrupted). 
Maria is the second Larraín 
ﬁ lm written by Steven Knight 
following their work together 
on Spencer; Knight was 
nominated for an Academy 
Award for original screenplay 
for his work on Dirty Pretty 
Things, and is the creator 
of Peaky Blinders.

Seeking proof there’s 
something new under the

meditation on love, loss and 
the search for meaning in

Add brilliant, painstakingly

NOVEMBER 1 AT 7 PM | REGAL
An insider account of the 
failed 2020 coup in Venezuela 
as told by former U.S. Army 
Green Beret Jordan Goudreau, 
a three-time Bronze Star 
recipient who organized the 
ill-fated mission. A mission 
to overthrow the Venezuelan 
government that was 
conceived of out of a WeWork 
in Miami – what could go 
wrong?
It’s a harrowing look into the 
realpolitik world of exiled leaders, 
private armies and shadowy 
intelligence operatives, and 
what made one man believe 
he could change the course of 
a nation’s history. Men of War
is a stranger-than-ﬁ ction story 
from directing duo Jen Gatien 
and Billy Corben, who, with 
his producing partner Alfred 
Spellman, has made a successful 
career out of exploring how 
Miami is a sunny place for

Magic City Hustle (MFF 2019),

romantic relationships in

NIGHTBITCH
Directed by 
Marielle Heller
USA | 2024 | 98 min 
English
OCTOBER 31 AT 7 PM | KOUBEK
A woman (Amy Adams) pauses 
her career to be a stay-at-home 
mom, but soon her new 
domesticity takes a surreal 
turn in Marielle Heller’s biting 
adaptation of the 2021 bestselling 
novel of the same name.
Nightbitch features Adams at 
her astounding best as a woman 
who grapples with the swift and 
drastic dif erence between her 
pre- and post-baby life. Once 
a successful artist and curator, 
she now ﬁ nds her days to be 
an endless stream of cooking, 
cleaning and playtime. She loves 
her child, but she’s lost her luster 
and sense of identity. But you 
know what they say – when one 
door closes, another opens. And 
this door might just resemble 
a doggy door, as she ﬁ nds 
something primal threatening to 
unleash from within her. Why are 
her inscisors looking extra sharp? 
What’s with her heightened 
sense of smell and the newly 
grown patch of hair on her back? 
Most of all, it’s her new desires 
that stand out, backed by a 
voracious appetite that won’t 
be ignored. 
SATURN RETURN
Directed by 
Isaki Lacuesta &
Pol Rodríguez
Spain, France | 2024 | 105 min

NOVEMBER 2 AT 12 PM | KOUBEK
Nominated as Spain’s of  cial 
entry for the 2025 Oscars, 
Saturn Return is a story of 
music and passion, with a 
hypnotic soundtrack.
In the late 1990s, art and culture 
are at their height in Granada and 
an indie rock music group is on a 
quest to record its third LP, which 
will either propel the band to 
stardom or see it fade into 
oblivion. The idea is to have the 
recording take place in New York, 
but everything becomes 
complicated, and the creative 
process turns into an ordeal. 
Relationships shatter, rehearsals 
become self-destructive and the 
unbearable pressure from the 
record label leads to arguments, 
only interrupted by ﬂ eeting 
moments of happiness. Yet, 
nobody realizes that they are 
creating an album that will 
forever change the music scene 
for an entire generation. 
Inspired by, but not based on, the 
story of the legendary Spanish 
band Los Planetas, this beautiful, 
disruptive drama highlights the 
complexity in creative work and 
showcases excellent performances 
from up-and-coming actors. 
THE SEED OF THE 
SACRED FIG
Directed by 
Mohammad Rasoulof
Iran, Germany, France
2024 | 168 min
Farsi with English subtitles
NOVEMBER 1 AT 7:30 PM | CGAC
Shot entirely in secret, 
Mohammad Rasoulof’s award-
winning thriller centers on a 
family thrust into the public 
eye when Iman is appointed 
as an investigating judge in 
Tehran. With the new position 
comes a signiﬁ cant boost in 
social stature, but it also comes 
with a caveat: With the eyes 
of the state hyperfocused on 
them, Iman makes it clear to 
his family that they are to be 
model citizens, making sure 
their behavior is constantly in 
line with what the government 
expects of them.
That task becomes easier 
said than done, as political 
unrest erupts in the streets as 
the “Women, Life, Freedom” 
movement starts to grow 
louder and more urgent. Soon, 
Iman realizes that his job is 
even more dangerous than 
expected, making him 
increasingly paranoid and 
distrustful – even of his own 
wife Najmeh, and daughters 
Sana and Rezvan.

NOVEMBER 1 AT 9:30 PM | REGAL
September 5 unveils the 
decisive moment that forever 
changed media coverage and 
continues to impact live news 
today. Set during the 1972 
Munich Olympics, the ﬁ lm 
follows an American sports 
broadcasting team that quickly 
adapted from sports reporting 
to live coverage of the Israeli 
athletes taken hostage. 
Through this lens, September 5
provides a powerful new 
perspective on the live 
broadcast seen globally by 
an estimated 1 billion people 
at the time. At the heart of 
the story is Geof , a young 
and ambitious producer 
striving to prove himself to 
his boss, the legendary TV 
executive Roone Arledge. 
Together with Marianne, a 
German interpreter, Geof  
unexpectedly takes the 
helm of the live coverage. 
As narratives shift, time ticks 
away and conﬂ icting rumors 
spread with the hostages’ lives 
hanging in the balance, Geof  
grapples with tough decisions 
while confronting his own 
moral compass.
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

Farsi and French with

NOVEMBER 2 AT 2:30 PM I SPOT
In a mysterious and surreal 
interzone somewhere between 
Tehran and Winnipeg, the 
lives of multiple characters 
interweave with each other 
in surprising and mysterious 
ways. Grade-schoolers Negin 
and Nazgol ﬁ nd a sum of 
money frozen in the winter ice 
and try to claim it. Meanwhile, 
Massoud leads a group of 
increasingly befuddled tourists 
through the monuments and 
historic sites of Winnipeg. 
Matthew quits his meaningless 
job in a Québecois government
of  ce and sets out upon an 
enigmatic journey to visit 
his mother. Space, time and 
personal identities cross-fade, 
interweave and echo into a 
surreal comedy of misdirection.
Winner of the inaugural 
Directors’ Fortnight audience 
award at Cannes this year, 
and screening to acclaim at 
the Toronto International Film 
Festival, Universal Language is 
charming and of beat. 
UNSTOPPABLE

NOVEMBER 2 AT 2:15 PM I KOUBEK
Come for the all-star cast 
(Jennifer Lopez, Michael Peña, 
Don Cheadle, Bobby Cannavale), 
stay for the true-life inspiration 
that will remain with you long 
after the house lights come 
up – and quite possibly forever 
change the way you view what 
is and is not possible.
Born without a right leg, 
Anthony Robles (portrayed 
here by Moonlight and When 
They See Us breakout star 
Jharrel Jerome) may have at 
ﬁ rst been an unlikely candidate 
for a future winner of a NCAA 
wrestling championship to 
everyone except the one who 
mattered most: himself. 
Based on Robles’ 2012 memoir, 
this of  cial selection of the 
2024 Toronto International 
Film Festival from the team 
behind 2023’s Air deftly 
interweaves heartfelt family 
drama and rousing 
mat-centered sports action, 
for a ﬁ lm that champions 
the potential outsized beneﬁ ts 
of both accessibility and 
positive mental attitude.
